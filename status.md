Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

The noun section of the project is complete with room for some tweaks to make it more accurate in the case of more irregular noun forms. I have figured out how to print multiple results in cases where the exact analysis is ambiguous. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not finished the corresponding verb part because I need to finish making the spreadsheet which the code draws from when printing analyses. However, once this spreadsheet is finished the verb part will quickly be finished. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

For a while I couldn't figure out how I was going to print multiple analyses when the exact form of a noun/verb was not definite, but I soon figured out how to utilize spreadsheets to accomplish this. It ultimately made my code much shorter than it originally was.
