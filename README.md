# Coding-Final-Project
This code is for parsing Latin nouns and verbs. Given a word, the code will return the possible analyses of the word as well as the form of the word you'd find in a standard Latin dictionary. 

Difficulties:
The main difficulty when I began this code was figuring out how to print multiple analyses for endings that are less delineated. I was able to solve this by creating charts of every possible ending for nouns and verbs. While it is not perfect since it cannot account for more irregular nouns and verbs, these exceptions should not obscure the code's range. The code would ultimately be much more accurate if it had access to a Latin dictionary. For example the word 'vocō' could theoretically be from the verb 'vocāre' or 'vocere,' but with a dictionary at hand the code would recognize there is no such verb 'vocere' and say with certainty that 'vocō' comes from vocāre. 

Helpfulness:
Despite these hurdles I believe this code could be helpful for beginner Latin students who have trouble recognizing noun and verb forms. Because each analysis gives the dictionary form of the word it will help teach how the endings change for different classes of nouns and verbs.
