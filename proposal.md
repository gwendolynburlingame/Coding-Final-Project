# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Latin Noun/Verb Analyzer 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The user will input a noun or a verb and will be told about their grammatical function. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In the case of a noun, it will explain its grammatical case, number(whether it's singular or plural), the gender of the noun, and which grouping of nouns it belongs two (in Latin there are 5 distinct types of nouns). It will first ask the user whether they already know any aspect of the noun before analyzing as this will allow for a more precise result, since nouns can sometimes have common endings. When the type of noun is ambigous, it will give the different possibilites. For example, a noun that ends in -um could either be accusative and masculine or nominative and neuter with respect to case and gender. In the context of a Latin sentence one will be able to tell which of these the noun is, but with the word isolated it can be difficult to say with 100% certainty. This process is essentially similar for verbs, except the information given for the verb is its person (1st/2nd/3rd/), number, tense, voice (active/passive), and mood. 

Currently I think this is possible by using a series of tests to see which classes the ending belongs too. For example with nouns there would be a list of uniquely feminine endings and the same with the other genders and then from there the other aspects would be determined. A parallel idea will be applied to verbs, though verbs have less overlap in endings. 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think no matter what it will be able to read most types of nouns and verbs. The areas which may prove difficult are: the moods of verbs and determining which noun group or "declension" a noun belongs to. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think it will be able to completely analyze verbs and nouns for their grammatical aspects and offer options when there are ambiguities in endings. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possibility is if I could have the code, using a latin dictionary, figure out what the given noun or verb is and then be certain, in the case of nouns, of their gender and declension and, and be almost wholly certain about every aspect of the verb. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll need to draw out the different possibilites for every ending, and figure out how to effectively systematize the analyzation of the latin word. I'll need to research Latin endings in more depth to ensure there are no faults and that it accounts for irregular verb and noun endings.
